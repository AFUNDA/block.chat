# Chat UI
This project value lies mainly on the messaging protocol, and I plan to spend the less amount of time possible with the actual messaging UI.

Some candidates for Chat UIs already built in HTML (in order of preference are):

- [Web chat widget](http://www.bypeople.com/web-chat-widget/)

Easy and clean

- [Bottom chat](http://www.bypeople.com/bottom-chat-widget/)

Would allow for a main UI with contact list and key ui, and then having the conversations in the bottom.
