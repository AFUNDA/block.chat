  "body": "As a fun little side-project and also as a way to document in a series of blog posts the state of the art in developing Dapps I'm going to be building BlockChat, a telegram-like messaging app using Public Key cryptography using the Eth blockchain as its backend.\r\n\r\nThe idea is for the protocol to be content agnostic (payloads will look like \"pt: Hi\" (for plaintext) or \"ipfs:...\" or even \"https:...\"), this way the content of the message can be very big without having to spend tons of gas in storage. \r\n\r\nIt is meant to be kind of a transport protocol for messages, also having encryption and timestamping built in.",
